"""Refuse a commit subject whose scope names a workflow but whose type is not ci.

CONTRIBUTING.md allows a scope naming a workflow only with type `ci`.
This repository has no script sharing a workflow's name, so the rule reaches
every workflow scope. Prose that no gate reads is a convention, not a rule;
this check enforces the documented scope rule.

The workflow-scope set is DERIVED at HEAD from the tracked files under
.github/workflows, not kept in a list here. A remembered list is only as
current as the last time somebody remembered to add to it, and a workflow
renamed out of the list would take its scope out of the rule in silence.
Both the top-level `name:` and the file stem enter the set: pr-gate.yml's
`pr gate` display name has spaces and cannot be a conventional scope, but
its `pr-gate` stem can. A job- or step-level `name:` is indented and must
not be collected.

Only the OUTGOING range origin/main..HEAD is examined, and the green line
says so. Already-merged history is what the check exists to stop repeating,
not what it re-tries: re-judging a merged commit would red every fetch of
main forever over commits nobody can amend.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, and says so rather than guessing:

  - A subject that does not parse — a merge commit, a non-conforming
    subject, anything without a lowercase type, a scope in parens and a
    colon. It is not a failure: it is counted and listed on stdout, so a
    green is never silent about what it skipped. Parsing it anyway would put
    a guessed scope under a gate it never agreed to.
  - A `name:` line this reader cannot read — quoted, anchored, a block
    scalar, a trailing comment, continued onto the next line, or missing
    entirely. Each is a refusal naming the file: an incomplete set is a
    green over a gate that was never checked, which is the same quiet
    narrowing a remembered list would drift into.
  - The type table's other half. A type outside CONTRIBUTING's convention is
    a defect under any scope, so no type is enumerated here: every type but
    `ci` violates when the scope names a workflow, and the scope rule is
    what fires.
  - A workflow display name containing spaces cannot itself be a scope
    (`[^()\\s]+`), but its file stem is still checked.

Runs on the standard library alone, and reads blobs with
`git cat-file blob HEAD:<path>` for the same reason gate_base_freshness
reads its workflows that way: in CI the working tree and HEAD are the same
commit, and at review time the tree somebody is editing is not the tree any
gate has agreed to judge.

    scripts/ci/commit_scopes.py [--root DIR]

--root points the check at a repository other than the one above scripts/ci/,
which is how the suite rehearses it against real fixtures.
