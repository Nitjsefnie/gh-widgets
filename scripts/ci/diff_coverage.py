"""How much of what THIS change added is covered, and what it missed.

The ratchet next door reports one number for the whole tree, and that number
barely moves: a pull request can add fifty uncovered lines to a 12,000-line
codebase and the total falls by a fraction of a point, which is inside the
buffer the floor already allows. So the tree-level figure cannot tell a
reviewer whether the code in front of them was tested — only whether the
repository as a whole still is.

This reports the other number: of the lines this change ADDED that coverage
considers executable, how many did the suites reach. It is deliberately NOT a
gate. A refactor that moves code between files, a change that only deletes,
and a fix whose test lives behind an optional dependency all produce a low
patch figure for reasons a reviewer should judge rather than a threshold
should block on.

Lines the diff added that coverage.py does not consider executable are
excluded: blank lines, comments, docstrings and `else:` are not measured
statements, and counting them would make the percentage depend on formatting.
For any changed Python source the XML does measure, every added executable
statement must have an XML record; an absent record is an invalid report,
never a smaller denominator.

The Cobertura XML from `coverage xml` (`--coverage`) and the unified diff
(`--diff`) are the only inputs. This repository measures Python only, so the
report never presents a number for a second language it did not measure.
